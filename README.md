# B.A.S.S.
# Basic Acronym Song Selector

# What is it?
B.A.S.S. asks the user for a genre and a word/phrase/sentence. It will create a private Spotify playlist with one song that begins with each letter in the user's string. All the songs will be in the user's specified genre. This is a fun and quirky way to discover new tracks in a specific genre, while controlling the number of songs in the playlist. Playlist name is the user string + the user genre, so you can get creative with the word/phrase/sentence and genre combinations. Enjoy!

# 1st Time Note:
You will need to set up the developer access with Spotify and get your own Client ID and Client Secret.
The first time you run this, you will get taken to a webpage. Allow Spotify access to your account (since it will be making a playlist for you).
You will then need to copy the url and paste it in as the input for the prompt the program gives you.
This is only a first time thing to give clearance for this program to make a playlist in your Spotify Account.
